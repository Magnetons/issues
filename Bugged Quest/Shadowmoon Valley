So guys the quest taht aint working as it should be is a chain one prob the last one from that npc.The quest is   [The Cipher of Damnation] and it starts from Oronot torn-heart and it  ends at (????) quest aint saying where it ends.
So how should teh quest work is u have to go to the Altar of Dammation and use The Cipher of Damnation there, then u wait as tehy speak (some neautral npcs) and then the elite mob spawns.
The issue about that elite mob is that u cant hit it with any spell,went on youtube and the elite started attacking the guy and btw the elite mob there wasnt so close to the altar(ID of q item ^^30657^^)
